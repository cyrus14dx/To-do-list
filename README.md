📝 To-Do List Website

A simple To-Do List web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and remove them. Tasks are also saved in local storage, so they won’t disappear when the page is refreshed.

This project is just a practice project to help me improve my JavaScript skills (DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage).
